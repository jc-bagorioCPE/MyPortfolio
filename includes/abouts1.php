        <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jc, and I am a student at Dr. Yanga's College Inc., passionate about leveraging technology to address real-world challenges. My current work focuses on applying AI and data-driven solutions to various fields, including solid waste management and traffic flow optimization. Some of my key projects involve smart recycling systems with image recognition and automated traffic management using predictive analytics. These initiatives aim to promote sustainability, efficiency, and better community living.</p>
        <p>Outside of my research, I enjoy listening to R&B music, which helps me stay inspired and balanced. I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and share innovative ideas with others who are equally passionate about technology and its potential to create a positive impact on society.</p>

Whether we’re sharing adventures or just spending time together, she reminds me of the importance of love and mutual growth. </p>
        <p>What I admire most about her is her determination and belief in me. She inspires me to be my best and encourages me through every challenge. Our bond, built on trust and respect, is something I deeply cherish, and I’m grateful for the love and strength she brings to my life.</p>
